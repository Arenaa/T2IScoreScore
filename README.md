# T2IScoreScore

**Who Evaluates the Evaluations? Assessing the Faithfulness and Consistency of Text-to-Image Evaluation Metrics with *T2IScoreScore***


We introduce **HalluVision** dataset! üì∏‚ú®

HalluVision is a meticulously curated dataset featuring image sets that smoothly transition from high to low faithfulness with respect to the given prompt. This collection includes both synthetic and natural examples, providing a comprehensive range for meta-evaluating existing Text-to-Image (T2I) metrics. Our goal is to facilitate the development of more accurate and consistent T2I metrics in the future.

*The HalluVision dataset is scheduled for publication soon!*
